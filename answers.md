5. Question: What is the purpose of E in this class definition?
E is a generic type. E is a placeholder for any data types that the user wants.
6. Question: What is the purpose of this in the second constructor definition?
The purpose of this in the second contrustor definition is the caller to the first constructor. Using this(data,null) would invoke the first contrustor to instantiate a node.
7. Question: What is the purpose of toString in this class definition?
The purpose of toString in this class definition is to return a string of a Node with its hashcode(reference), data, and if its next node is not null then also return the next node hashcode.
10. The second way because you are providing the reference for the 'next' node by using the first contrustor to create a link between the nodes.
15. It will be an infinite loop because the successor is referenced to the head and no node is referenced to null.

18. The shape of any noncyclical structure would be a linear structure Node.
Ex. NodeA -> NodeB -> NodeC -> Null
Yes, you can. You can have many references as you want from each branch.

20. Yes, becauuse arrayList, linkedList use the same list interface.
